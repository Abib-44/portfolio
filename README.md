# Portfolio

This repository contains my personal **portfolio website**.

The site is designed to present my professional profile, selected projects, and technical competencies in a clear and minimal form. It serves both as a showcase of completed work and as a practical demonstration of frontend and static-site development skills.

## Live Demo

The portfolio is publicly available at the following URL:

👉 **https://abib-44.github.io/portfolio/**

## Tech Stack

The project is built using a deliberately lightweight and transparent stack:

- **Jekyll** – static site generator used for structure, templating, and content organization  
- **HTML** – semantic markup for content and layout  
- **CSS** – styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – client-side interactivity and dynamic behavior  

No heavy frameworks are used. The emphasis is on clarity, maintainability, and direct control over the rendered output.

## Purpose

- Act as a professional portfolio
- Showcase projects and technical skills
- Demonstrate proficiency with static-site architectures
- Provide a fast, accessible, and easily deployable website

## Deployment

The site is deployed via **GitHub Pages**, leveraging Jekyll’s native integration for static hosting.

This repository is intentionally simple: the codebase is meant to be readable, inspectable, and representative of practical engineering choices rather than framework-driven complexity.
